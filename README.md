Our platform helps students and hobbyists turn ideas into actionable projects instantly. Users enter a project topic—like ‘IoT air quality monitor’—and get a complete, easy-to-follow plan: diagrams, component recommendations with pros and cons, step-by-step instructions, testing tips, and references. It even explains the theory behind key components and offers an AI mentor to guide decisions. Unlike search engines or tutorials, it delivers structured, practical guidance that saves time and accelerates learning.
